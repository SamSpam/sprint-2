#H1 Key Principles of User-Centred Design
#H2 1 Build it for purpose
Consider the end-user and their goals and needs. Design the program to meet those needs such that the end-user is satisfied and are able to optimise their use of your product.

#H2 2 Design predictable interface
Make use of the user's prior experience working with computers, and design the program to integrate their prior knowledge with your new functions or tools.

#H2 3 Be logical
Present task flow logically to the user without excess information or content.

#H2 4 Do the thinking so the user doesn't have to
Make the interaction of the user with the computer simple to avoid frustration and malfunction.

#H2 5 Be responsive
Ensure that the user knows when they've successfully completed a task by providing feedback responsively.

#H2 6 Empower the user with control
Provide the user with adequate navigation mechanisms and knowledge of their situation within the program.

#H2 7 Empower the user with leadership capability
Let the user decide what actions they take in the sequence which suits them. Don't define this for them, but provide them with options to choose from.

#H2 8 Reduce clutter
Provide enough information for the user to achieve their objectives, but not more than needed so as not to clutter their screen and cause confusion and frustration.

#H2 9 Serve the user
Be helpful and supportive of the user's experience and goals. Provide useful and constructive help.

#H2 10 Design for success
Reduce the opportunity for the user to make mistakes by guiding them appropriately.

#H2 Important Principles
Personally, the three most potent principles are number 1, number 9 and number 10. **Build it for purpose** is vital, because the biggest mistake that a developer could make is to build something that nobody wants to use, or doesn't solve anyone's problem. The process of understanding what it is that users want, to me, is an essential component for a software developer to understand before beginning. Second, **Serve the user** encompasses other goals such as being logical and making the process and navigation easy for the user - getting in the mindset of actually how the user experiences the product. I imagine that this perspective allows the developer to omit or include much of their work based on how the product will be used. Lastly, **Design for Success** is important for both the user and yourself as a develoer/business/organisation, for obvious reasons.

#H2 Unimportant principles
Principles 2 and 6 are less important in my point of view. If we're designing for purpose and success, then the actual manifestation should follow logically. If this involves a known or **predictable** interface, then so be it, but if the interface is novel for any reason, then as long as it aligns with the previously stated goals then I see no problem with it. Perhaps as a general rule it's advisable to design common interfaces, but I wouldn't consider it steadfast. The same principle applies to 6, to provide the user with navigation mechanisms through the program. Perhaps the purpose of the software doesn't require such control by the user, and the extent to which the user can control the experience is determined by the purpose and function of the project.

#H2 Reflections
This video surprised me to the extent that my stereotyped view of programmers is that they're anti-social and don't engage with the human experience as much as some other professionals might. Of course, I know that this isn't the case, but suspect that it's the case for some coders out there. In terms of the content, I'm not surprised that designing for UCD is essential to a successful product, and that going back to redo the whole process is costly and sometimes fatal to the product or company. Thus, as a programmer I'm particularly interested in this design process and how to understand from the end-user what it is that's needed before jumping into the code.
