#H1 Agile
Agile development is a framework designed for programmers to achieve programming objectives more efficiently and effectively through an iterative process.

The *Agile Manifesto* was defined in 2001 after a series of Agile methodologies were devised in the mid-90's, including Scrum in 1995, which Dev uses. The Agile Manifesto is as follows:

“We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we have come to value:

1. Working software over comprehensive documentation
2. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
3. Responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."

*…Manifesto for Agile Software Development, Authors: Beck, Kent, et al. (2001)*

Agile therefore works to describe a way of working together for programmers, and a basis from which to understand relationships that exist within and among programming spheres. It puts people, product and principle first, rather than the process or practice.
#H2 Key principles of Agile inlude:
- Customer satisfaction and delivery
- Welcoming change
- Communication is jey
- Environment and Trust
- Face-to-face Communication
- Software as Measure of Progress
- Sustainable development
- Attention to Details
- The Power of Less
- Self-organizing Teams

#H2 Scrum Methodology
The Scrum methodology is what Dev Academy uses to organise it's workflow. It focuses on task management within a team using an iterative and incremental development model. It's relatively simple to implement and focuses on quick and frequent deliveries.

#H3 Scrum Roles

Scrum involves three roles:
1. ScrumMaster - responsible for smooth process, removing obstables to productivity, organising and facilitating meetings
2. Product Owner - responsible for maximising the value of the product by managing Product Backlog.
3. the Team - self-organizing and cross-functional. Comprises of analysts, designers, developers, testers, etc. The team works together closely on a daily basis to deliver the product iteratively and incrementally.

#H3 Scrum Events
#H4 The sprint
A two or four week long development increment with its own defined goals and outcomes. It is overseen by the Product Owner, and can be canceled only by her, although this rarely happens. Sprints occur in succession with identical duration, and are planned in a *Sprint Planning* meeting.
#H4 Sprint Planning
The Scrum Master is responsible for moderating, coordinating and executing the Sprint Planning meeting which happens once every sprint in preparation for the next sprint. It requires up to four hours for a 2 week sprint, or 8 for a one month sprint.
#H5 Questions addressed are:
- What needs to br and can be delivered in the Sprint Increment?
- How will the work needed for the execution of Sprint be achieved?
#H5 The Inputs to the meeting are:
- The Product Backlog
- The Latest Product Increment
- Projected capacity of the Team during the sprint
- Past performance of the Team

The Planning meeting is a collaborative session whereby the Product Owner provides clarification on the Product Backlog items and the Team defines what can be achieved within the next Sprint cycle. A *Sprint Goal* is then defined and a calendar of work tasks is defined for each day of the Sprint cycle.

#H4 Daily Scrum meetings
15-minute meeting daily coordinated by the Scrum Master. Also called Daily Stand up meeting.
The meeting covers:
- What did team members do to meet the Sprint Goal yesterday?
- What will they do today to help the Team meet the Sprint Goal?
- Do they see any impediments that prevent them or the Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

#H4 Sprint Review
Coordinated by the Scrum Master and held at the end of every sprint to determine what was achieved, and any changes to the Product Backlog.
Includes the following aspects:
- Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders, as invited by the Product Owner.
- The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been completed during the sprint and what has not been completed.
- The Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved.
- The Team demonstrates the work that it has completed and answers questions, if any, about the Increment.
- The entire group then discusses on what to do next. Thus, the Sprint Review provides valuable input to Sprint Planning of the subsequent Sprint.
- The Scrum Team then reviews the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated release of the product increment.
- The outcome of the Sprint Review is an updated Product Backlog, which defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint.

#H4 Sprint Retrospective
Occurs after Sprint Review and prior to Spring Planning
To:
- Combine the learnings from the last Sprint, with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools.
- Identify the major items that went well and potential improvements.
- Creation of a plan for implementing improvements to increase product quality.
