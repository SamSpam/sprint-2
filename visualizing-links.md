#Guidelines for Visualizing Links
##What is the rule for underlinking text that is *not* a link?
**Don't** underline any text that is not a link.
##How should the unvisited link color compare to the visited link color in terms of:
a. Brightness - unvisited link should be brighter
b. Hue - the colors should be variants of the same color
c. Visibility to color blindness - provide redundant cues for color-blind users
##What is a "perceived affordance"?
The quality of an object that suggests how it might be used. Describes the qualities of the visual world that suggest the possibility of interaction.
##When can you safely eliminate underlines for links?
If an underline appears when the cursor hovers over the link.
##Should you use blue for text?
No, avoid blue for text as it's the most well=recognised link color and will likely be mistaken.
##If links are not underlined, what can you do to improve link discovery by users?
Animate the link when the cursor hovers over it, such as change the color, add an underline, or show a pop-out.
##What are link titles and ho might you use them?
Link titles are an informational box that pop up when the cursor appears over the link to inform users where the link directs to. This may be used to help users with deciding whether to navigate there or not.
