#H2 Notes on Corey Haines' Article
#H3 Driver-Navigator
Critique of this approach is that this form leads to a "Driver-Twitterer" style of collaboration whereby the Navigator loses interest and reverts to Twitter, email or another distracted task. This is a result of a lack of communication from the Dirver, and a lack of collaboration.

To avert this, there must be consistent communication between the pair, where one keeps the other constantly abreast of their thoughts. This style can be difficult for a new pair, and Haines considers an intermediate level which he discourages.

#H3 Ping-Pong Pairing
Two forms, both involving frequent code writing by each pair member.
First form: Test Redder/Test greener
Whereby test code is written by the first, then passed by the second member on an ongoing and iterative fashion.
First form: Flip-flop ping-pong
Whereby the roles of test redder and test greener flip-flop between the pair.


#H3 Conclusion
Haines recommends using the second form or pairing for beginners, and to advance to regular Driver-Navigator pairing when communication and collaboration becomes more fluent.
